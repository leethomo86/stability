      -f matrix_file                   Input matrix file with set of molecular orbitals and two-
                                       electron integrals.

      --neigs neigs                    Number of orbital rotation Hessian eigenvalues to print.
                                       Default is 5.

      --vecThresh vecThresh            Lowest limit for orbital rotation Hessian eigenvalue 
                                       component to be printed. Default is 0.1.

                                       2) mat

      -o output_file                   Output file name. Default is input file name.

   2. Stability test

      --wf-test test_string            Specifies the type of instability to be tested. Note that
                                       only symmetries of the same type or lower than the input
                                       wavefunction symmetry are valid. The default is to test 
                                       for an internal instability. Options are: 
                                       1) R
                                          Test for real instabilities.
                                       2) C 
                                          Test for complex instabilities.
                                       3) A 
                                          Test for all instabilities.

   3. Vector following

      --follow vector                  Specifies the vectors to follow when returning a matrix
                                       file with a perturbed set of molecular orbitals. Input 
                                       vectors are given as a column separated list enclosed in 
                                       square brackets. The default is not to return a matrix file.

      --coordinate coordinate          Specifies which coordinate type to follow
                                       1) eigenvector (default)
                                          Step in the direction of the raw Hessian eigenvectors.
                                       2) gradient 
                                          Step in the direction of the gradient.
                                       3) newton
                                          Step in the direction of the gradient projected onto
                                          the Hessian eigenvectors.
                                       4) connect 
                                          Step in the direction of the solution connected by
                                          the specified Hessian eigenvectors. This option does
                                          eigenvector steps until the projected gradient along 
                                          the specified Hessian eigenvectors becomes too small.

      --step step-size                 Size of step when following a vector to return perturbed 
                                       set of molecular orbitals. As only first order Zassenhaus 
                                       formula is implemented, only small step sizes should be used.
                                       Default is 0.05. 

      --nsteps steps                   Number of steps when following a vector. Default is 1. 

      --connect-angle angle            The angle from perpendicular of the gradient and step vector
                                       to specify when the connect algorithm should switch
                                       from following the eigenvector to doing Newton steps.

   4. Help
      --help                           Output help documentation to terminal.

NOTES
      Compilation of this program requires the MQC library (https://github.com/MQCPack/mqcPack)
      and the gauopen utility (http://gaussian.com/g16/gauopen.zip) and compilation with the
      f08 standard.

      Compilation tested using: gfortran 9.2.0

      Note that subroutine Wr_LCBuf needs modifying in gauopen/qcmatrix.F as follows:
        line 58:       LenBX = (LenBuf/(2*abs(NR)))*abs(NR)
        line 60:       Call Wr_CBuf(IU,NTot*abs(NR),LenBX,X)

      Documentation generated with robodoc. To update documentation edit robodoc.rc to
      determine documentation output type and then run robodoc at the command line in the
      main directory.
