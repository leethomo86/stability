NAME
      SCF Stability Calculator
SYNOPSIS
      Computes the stability of an SCF wavefunction.
USAGE
      stable [-f <matrix_file>] [--print-level <print_level>] [--help]
OPTIONS
   1. Input/output

      -f matrix_file                   Input matrix file with set of molecular orbitals and two-
                                       electron integrals. 

      --print-level print_level        Verbosity of output. Default print level is 1. Options
                                       0-4.

      --neigs neigs                    Number of orbital rotation Hessian eigenvalues to print.
                                       Default is 5.

      --vecThresh vecThresh            Lowest limit for orbital rotation Hessian eigenvalue 
                                       component to be printed. Default is 0.1.

      --follow vector                  Specifies the vector to follow when returning a matrix
                                       file with a perturbed set of molecular orbitals. Default 
                                       is not to return a matrix file which is 0.

      --step step-size                 Size of step when following a vector to return perturbed 
                                       set of molecular orbitals. As only first order Zassenhaus 
                                       formula is implemented, only small step sizes should be used.
                                       Default is 0.05. 

      --wf-test test_string            Specifies the type of instability to be tested. Note that
                                       only symmetries of the same type or lower than the input
                                       wavefunction symmetry are valid. The default is to test 
                                       for an internal instability. Options are: 
                                       1) R
                                          Test for real instabilities.
                                       2) C 
                                          Test for complex instabilities.

      --otype extension                Format of output file. Options are:
                                       1) chk (default)
                                       2) mat

      -o output_file                   Output file name. Default is input file name.

      --help                           Output help documentation to terminal.

NOTES
      Compilation of this program requires the MQC library (https://github.com/MQCPack/mqcPack)
      and the gauopen utility (http://gaussian.com/g16/gauopen.zip) and compilation with the
      f08 standard.

      Compilation tested using: gfortran 9.2.0

      Note that subroutine Wr_LCBuf needs modifying in gauopen/qcmatrix.F as follows:
        line 58:       LenBX = (LenBuf/(2*abs(NR)))*abs(NR)
        line 60:       Call Wr_CBuf(IU,NTot*abs(NR),LenBX,X)

      Documentation generated with robodoc. To update documentation edit robodoc.rc to
      determine documentation output type and then run robodoc at the command line in the
      main directory.
